# Hi, Iâ€™m Julian - Embedded Systems Engineer 

I design and build **firmware + hardware systems** that bridge electronics and software.  
Currently exploring IoT, motor control, and real-time data logging.

### Skills
- **Firmware:** C/C++, bare-metal, RTOS, interrupt-driven drivers
- **Hardware:** STM32, MSP430, MSP432, Raspberry Pi Pico, Arduino
- **Interfaces:** I2C, SPI, UART, GPIO, ADC
- **Tools:** GNU Arm Toolchain, mySQL, Git, Bash

### Featured Projects
- [**Linux-Based Embedded Systems Development (CIA-Sponsored Project)**](link) â€” Linux-based embedded farm automation system integrating C++/Python motor + LiDAR control with cloud-connected machine learning crop analysis
- [**Lead Embedded Systems Developer â€“ Hybrid Stepper Motor**](link) â€” Embedded C firmware on MSP430 for hybrid stepper motor control with I2C light sensorâ€“based input feeback
- [**Autonomous Maze-Navigation Robot**](link) â€” MSP432-based autonomous maze-navigation robot with IR sensors and C++ PID-controlled wheel actuation for precise path tracking.
- [**Raspberry Pi-based Embedded System Projects**](link) â€” Vice President, IEEE â€” led Raspberry Pi embedded projects and obtained $5,000 sponsorship to increase student participation.
- [**Full-Stack Web Development with Python**](link) â€” Full-stack tennis scheduling web app using Flask and MySQL with dynamic, responsive interfaces and optimized queries.

### Currently Learning
- FreeRTOS / RTOS concepts (task scheduling, semaphores, queues)
- Machine learning inference on microcontrollers (TinyML, edge AI)
